Master Thesis submitted by Jehyun Roh (Wirtschaftsinformatik Master student at HU Berlin)<br/>

The Main Experiment codes are<br/>
-- Experiment_1_Baseline_Models(LR,_LSTM).ipynb<br/>
-- Experiment 2 BERT with Active Learning.ipynb<br/>

The Final Visualization Graphs are <br/>
-- Results Graph Visualizaions.ipynb<br/>
<br/>
The already pre-processed and then randomly selected 12,000 instances of some datasets are in the zipped folder in the mail with the thesis pdf file.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the codes are following<br/>
-- WordCloud,_etc.ipynb: codes for making wordclouds and some EDA that were not included in the final thesis<br/>
