# Active-Learning-for-Fake-News-Classification-Using-BERT
Master Thesis submitted by Jehyun Roh (Wirtschaftsinformatik Master student at HU Berlin)

The Main Experiment codes are
-- Experiment_1_Baseline_Models(LR,_LSTM).ipynb
-- Experiment 2 BERT with Active Learning.ipynb

The Final Visualization Graphs are 
-- Results Graph Visualizaions.ipynb

The already pre-processed and then randomly selected 12,000 instances of some datasets are in the zipped folder in the mail with the thesis pdf file.

The rest of the codes are following
-- WordCloud,_etc.ipynb: codes for making wordclouds and some EDA that were not included in the final thesis
-- Politifact Dataset Scraper.ipynb: This is for webscraping the additional data for the PolitiFact dataset used in the paper
